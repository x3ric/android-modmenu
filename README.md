# Introduction

A **floating mod menu** designed for il2cpp and other native Android games. It includes **KittyMemory**, **MSHook**, **And64InlineHook**, and a basic string obfuscator (**AY obfuscator**). All assets are stored as base64 in the C++ code, eliminating the need to store them in the assets folder.

# Known Bugs

- **Android 11**: Spinner may not display on some devices. It should work correctly on **Android 12**.
- In some games, the menu uses outdated layouts (e.g., KitKat or Gingerbread) when launched without the proper permissions. A fix has not yet been found.
